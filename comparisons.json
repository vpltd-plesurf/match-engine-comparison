Weak foot suppression 0.85x on distScore. FK routing: indirect=pass only, low curve=0.3x shot.\n\nSHOT EXECUTION: 4x SHOT_INACCURACY_MULTIPLIER. Error range 8-28°. Clamp ±8.0m. Weak foot power reduction. Low-skill height inaccuracy.\n\nGK AI [17 Feb]: Pre-shot awareness (positions on shooting arc 0.5s before shot). Organic dive (40% instant + 60% via movement — no teleport). Advanced penalty saves (anticipation-weighted 42/16/42 direction bias). Goal kick intent (dedicated targeting function). Clearance clamping.\n\nSAVE MECHANICS: Height gate fixed (2.6m). Trajectory prediction. Catch rates improved (~25-40%). 8m save trigger range. Catch/parry/punch/fumble pipeline. 12 dive types for animation.\n\nREMAINING ISSUE: Despite good per-shot mechanics, decision interval (0.15s floor) creates ~7 decisions/sec for top players → too many shot opportunities in 5,400s match.

Slowing this down by 3-4x immediately reduces action frequency across the entire match.\n\nAREA 2 — BALL CONTROL AND TRANSITION TIME: Control phase (0.2-0.8s) and action cooldowns (0.8-1.5s) are too short. A real footballer needs 1-2 seconds to control and look up, plus time for the pass to travel. Each possession chain should take 3-5 seconds per player touch, not 1.7s.\n\nAREA 3 — DEFENSIVE EFFECTIVENESS: Interception radius too small (0.65-1.25m), tackle trigger too tight (1.4m commit, 3.0m challenge range), defenders walk at 2.2m/s during tactical repositioning. Defenders need to cover more ground, intercept more passes, and win more duels.\n\nAREA 4 — PRESSING AND MARKING: Only 2 players press (should allow 3), trigger distance 12m (should be 18-22m), defenders abandon marking when ball crosses midline. These gaps create easy passing lanes and free attackers on transitions.\n\nAREA 5 — SHOOTING DIFFICULTY: Thresholds 0.72/0.82 too easy from close range with boosts (1.44x inside 10m). Shot inaccuracy 4x still allows too many on-target shots over 5,400 seconds. Need higher thresholds and more inaccuracy to match 33-38% on-target rate.\n\nAREA 6 — GOALKEEPER EFFECTIVENESS: GK save rate needs to be ~72% of shots on target. Current system may be below this. Dive speed, reaction time, and positioning all need tuning for longer match duration.\n\nAREA 7 — DEAD BALL TIME: Real football has only ~58 min of 90 in play (64%). FM2026 has minimal dead ball time. More realistic set-piece setup times, throw-in delays, and free kick preparation would reduce effective playing time and total actions.",
    "codeSuggestions": "COMPREHENSIVE REBALANCE: 7 areas of change to achieve realistic scorelines (0-0 through 5-0 range, average ~1.4 goals/team) in a full 90-minute real-time simulation. Apply ALL areas together for best results — they are interdependent.\n\n========================================\nAREA 1: SLOW DOWN DECISION CADENCE\n========================================\nThis is the single biggest lever. Players currently think 2x per second — they should think every 2-4 seconds during build-up.\n\nFile: playerStateController.js (lines 147-160)\nCurrent:\n  const base = 0.35 + (1 - vision / 100) * 0.40;  // 0.35-0.75s\n  const variance = 0.15 + (1 - composure / 100) * 0.25;  // 0.15-0.40s\n  return Math.max(0.50, base + randomOffset);\n\nSuggested:\n  const base = 1.5 + (1 - vision / 100) * 1.5;  // 1.5-3.0s\n  const variance = 0.3 + (1 - composure / 100) * 0.7;  // 0.3-1.0s\n  return Math.max(1.5, base + randomOffset);\n\nRationale: A 1.5s minimum (up from 0.5s) means players think every 1.5-4.0s. Over 5,400s, this reduces total decisions from ~10,800 to ~2,700 per player — matching real football tempo where a player touches the ball 40-60 times per match.\n\nIMPORTANT: Consider adding a ZONE-BASED modifier — faster decisions in the final third (1.0s-2.0s) and slower in build-up (2.0s-4.0s). This creates realistic tempo acceleration near goal:\n  const zoneFactor = isInFinalThird ? 0.65 : (isInOwnHalf ? 1.3 : 1.0);\n  return Math.max(1.0, (base + randomOffset) * zoneFactor);\n\n========================================\nAREA 2: INCREASE BALL CONTROL AND TRANSITION TIMES\n========================================\n\n--- 2A: Longer control phase ---\nFile: playerAIController.js (lines 608-628)\nCurrent:\n  const controlTimeNeeded = Math.max(0.2, 0.8 - (controlAttr / 200));\n\nSuggested:\n  const controlTimeNeeded = Math.max(0.8, 2.0 - (controlAttr / 100));\n\nNew range: 0.8s (control=100+) to 2.0s (control=0). Average player (control=65): ~1.35s.\nThis simulates the time to trap, settle, and look up before deciding.\n\n--- 2B: Longer action cooldowns ---\nFile: playerEngine.js\nCurrent pass cooldown (line 81): 0.8s → Change to: 1.8s\nCurrent shot cooldown (line 133): 1.5s → Change to: 3.5s\nCurrent dribble cooldown (line 157): 1.2s → Change to: 2.5s\n\nRationale: After playing a pass, a player shouldn't make another decision for ~2 seconds (jog into space, reposition). After shooting, ~3.5 seconds (recovery, getting back in play). Combined with the 1.5-4s decision interval, each player touches the ball every 3-6 seconds — matching real football.\n\n--- 2C: Longer possession time limit ---\nFile: playerAIController.js (DRIBBLE.POSSESSION_TIME_LIMIT)\nCurrent: 2.5s → Change to: 5.0s\nRationale: Allows more build-up dribbling and holding play. 2.5s forces panic passing.\n\n--- 2D: Increase hesitation ---\nFile: playerAIController.js (lines 630-651)\nCurrent:\n  const hesitationChance = clamp((0.3 - (compositeSkill / 100 * 0.3)) * fatigueImpact, 0.02, 0.5);\n\nSuggested:\n  const hesitationChance = clamp((0.5 - (compositeSkill / 100 * 0.35)) * fatigueImpact, 0.08, 0.6);\n\nNew range: 8% (elite) to 60% (low skill). This adds realistic pauses — even world-class players don't instantly execute every time they receive.\n\n========================================\nAREA 3: STRENGTHEN DEFENSIVE EFFECTIVENESS\n========================================\n\n--- 3A: Larger interception radius ---\nFile: gameEngine.js (_checkBallPickup, around line 280)\nCurrent:\n  const baseRadius = 0.65;\n  const speedBonus = Math.max(0, 1 - planarSpeed / 12) * 0.6;\n\nSuggested:\n  const baseRadius = 1.4;\n  const speedBonus = Math.max(0, 1 - planarSpeed / 18) * 1.0;\n\nNew range: 1.4m (fast ball) to 2.4m (slow ball). This means defenders in the passing lane actually intercept passes rather than watching the ball zip past within arm's reach. The increase from 0.65m to 1.4m reflects a real player's ability to stick out a leg, chest-trap, or head an interception.\n\n--- 3B: Wider challenge trigger range ---\nFile: challengeController.js (around line 124)\nCurrent: challenge triggers within 3.0m\nSuggested: increase to 4.5m\nRationale: A defender 4m away can lunge, extend a leg, or body-block. 3.0m is too tight.\n\n--- 3C: Wider tackle commitment distance ---\nFile: aiPress.js (lines 214-238)\nCurrent: 1.4m commitment to tackle\nSuggested: 2.2m\nRationale: Slide tackles cover 2-3m in real football. Standing tackles reach ~1.5-2m with leg extension.\n\n--- 3D: Faster defensive repositioning ---\nFile: playerEngine.js (around line 318)\nCurrent: tactical positioning speed = 2.2 m/s (walking)\nSuggested: 3.5 m/s (jogging) when ball is in own half, 2.8 m/s otherwise\n  const defSpeed = ballInOwnHalf ? 3.5 : 2.8;\nRationale: Defenders jog to position, they don't walk. 2.2 m/s lets attackers sprint past repositioning defenders every time.\n\n--- 3E: Reduce transition lag ---\nFile: supportController.js (around line 145)\nCurrent: 0.9s formation freeze after turnover\nSuggested: 0.4s\nRationale: Real defenders start tracking runs within 1-2 steps of losing the ball. 0.9s at sprint speed = 5m+ of free running for attackers, which is an entire counter-attack.\n\n========================================\nAREA 4: IMPROVE PRESSING AND MARKING\n========================================\n\n--- 4A: Increase press trigger distance ---\nFile: aiPress.js (PRESS_TRIGGER_DISTANCE)\nCurrent: 12m → Suggested: 20m\nRationale: Modern pressing starts much further out. Liverpool's press triggers at 25-30m from the ball carrier in real life. 12m means only engaging when the attacker is already dangerously close.\n\n--- 4B: Allow 3 players to press ---\nFile: aiPress.js (line 177)\nCurrent: myRank <= 1 (max 2 pressers)\nSuggested: myRank <= 2 (max 3 pressers)\nRationale: Real defensive pressing involves a ball-side triangle — one player presses, two cover passing lanes. This dramatically reduces easy passing options.\n\n--- 4C: Fix defender marking past midline ---\nFile: aiOffBall.js (lines 518-520)\nCurrent: defenders completely stop man-marking when ball is in opponent half\nSuggested: defenders in own half should ALWAYS track nearby attackers, regardless of ball position. Only defenders who have pushed up past midfield should drop marking:\n  const shouldMark = !pastMidline || (player.pos.x * attackDir < 0);  // Always mark if in own half\nRationale: The current behaviour means on any turnover, attackers in the defensive half are completely unmarked for the first 1-2 seconds. This is the single biggest exploit for counter-attacks.\n\n========================================\nAREA 5: INCREASE SHOOTING DIFFICULTY\n========================================\n\n--- 5A: Raise shot thresholds ---\nFile: aiConstants.js (lines 9-10)\nCurrent:\n  THRESHOLD_CLOSE: 0.72\n  THRESHOLD_DISTANT: 0.82\n\nSuggested:\n  THRESHOLD_CLOSE: 0.82\n  THRESHOLD_DISTANT: 0.92\n\nRationale: With the 1.44x close-range boost, the current 0.72 threshold is reached from a raw score of just 0.50 inside the box. That's too easy — half the time a player faces the goal inside the box, they shoot. Raising to 0.82 means they need a raw score of 0.57+, requiring good angle AND low pressure.\n\n--- 5B: Increase shot inaccuracy ---\nFile: aiConstants.js (SHOT_INACCURACY_MULTIPLIER)\nCurrent: 4.0 → Suggested: 7.0\nRationale: Target on-target rate is 33-38%. With 4x, too many shots still find the target over 5,400 seconds. 7x means more shots sail wide or over the bar, matching real football where ~62-67% of shots miss the target entirely.\n\n--- 5C: Widen shot aim error range ---\nFile: aiShot.js (around lines 185-220)\nCurrent:\n  BASE_ERROR_MIN: 8.0 (shooting=100)\n  BASE_ERROR_MAX: 28.0 (shooting=0)\n\nSuggested:\n  BASE_ERROR_MIN: 12.0\n  BASE_ERROR_MAX: 40.0\nRationale: Even elite strikers miss the target ~45% of the time in real football. The wider error range creates more realistic shot scatter.\n\n--- 5D: Add team-wide shot cooldown ---\nFile: playerAIController.js or gameEngine.js\nNew mechanic: After any player on a team shoots, suppress all shot scores for that team by 50% for 15 seconds.\n  if (matchState.lastShotTime[teamIdx] && (now - matchState.lastShotTime[teamIdx]) < 15.0) {\n      shotScore *= 0.5;\n  }\nRationale: Real football teams don't shoot every time they enter the box. After a shot, play typically resets — goal kick, corner, or the other team clears. A 15-second suppression creates natural gaps between shots matching real football rhythm of ~1 shot every 6-7 minutes per team.\n\n--- 5E: Reduce close-range stacking boosts ---\nFile: playerAIController.js (around the shot boost section)\nCurrent boosts: 1.05x at 25m, 1.15x at 16m, 1.25x at 10m (stacks to ~1.44x)\nSuggested: 1.03x at 25m, 1.08x at 16m, 1.12x at 10m (stacks to ~1.24x)\nRationale: Current 1.44x makes the 0.72 threshold effectively 0.50 at point blank. With the new 0.82 threshold and 1.24x boost, the effective threshold inside the box is 0.66, still requiring decent angle and low pressure.\n\n========================================\nAREA 6: STRENGTHEN GOALKEEPER\n========================================\n\n--- 6A: Faster GK reaction time ---\nFile: keeperAction.js (reaction delay calculation)\nCurrent: 0.03 * (1.5 - agility/200 - confidence/200) = 0.015-0.045s\nSuggested: 0.02 * (1.5 - agility/150 - confidence/150) = 0.007-0.030s\nRationale: GKs need to be slightly faster to react over more shots across 90 minutes. The cumulative effect matters.\n\n--- 6B: Increase GK catch radius ---\nFile: physicsConstants.js\nCurrent GK_CATCH_RADIUS: 3.0m → Suggested: 3.5m\nCurrent GK_PARRY_RADIUS: 4.5m → Suggested: 5.5m\nRationale: GKs should cover more of the goal. This increases save rate toward the target 72%.\n\n--- 6C: Improve GK positioning advance ---\nFile: aiKeeper.js\nThe GK should narrow the angle more aggressively. Consider increasing the advance distance by 20-30% for central shots (ball within 15m laterally), so the GK cuts off more of the goal before the shot is taken.\n\n--- 6D: Add shot-blocking by outfield defenders ---\nNew mechanic (suggested): When a shot is launched, any outfield defender within 3m of the ball trajectory and facing the ball should have a chance to block it (proportional to bravery + positioning attributes). This currently doesn't exist. Real football sees ~25% of shots blocked by outfield defenders before reaching the GK.\n  Target: 20-25% of shots should be blocked by defenders.\n  Implementation: In the tick after a shot is launched, check each defender within 4m of the ball path. Block chance = (bravery/200 + positioning/200) * proximityFactor. If blocked, deflect ball with reduced speed.\n\n========================================\nAREA 7: INCREASE DEAD BALL TIME\n========================================\n\nTarget: ~32 minutes of dead ball time per 90-minute match (real football: ~42 min, but some is injury/VAR which doesn't apply).\n\n--- 7A: Longer set piece setup ---\nFile: matchFlowController.js\nCurrent free kick positioning timeout: 8.0s → Suggested: 12.0s\nCurrent other restart positioning: 4.0s → Suggested: 6.0s\nCurrent goal celebration: 5.0-7.0s → Suggested: 8.0-12.0s\n\n--- 7B: Add throw-in delay ---\nCurrent: throw-ins appear to restart quickly\nSuggested: add 3-5 second delay for throw-in setup (player retrieves ball, walks to line, waits for teammates)\n\n--- 7C: Add goal kick delay ---\nSuggested: 4-6 second delay before goal kick can be taken (GK places ball, surveys options).\n\n========================================\nEXPECTED RESULTS AFTER ALL CHANGES\n========================================\n\nWith all 7 areas applied together:\n- Decision rate drops from ~2/sec to ~0.5/sec → ~4x fewer decisions\n- Control + cooldown time means each touch takes 3-5s instead of 1.7s\n- Defensive interceptions increase ~3x (larger radius + more pressing)\n- Shot threshold + accuracy changes filter ~60-70% more shot attempts\n- GK + shot blocking saves ~75% of on-target shots\n- Dead ball time adds ~25 minutes of non-play\n\nNet effect on shots: ~180-270 per team → ~10-16 per team (matches real football 12-14)\nNet effect on goals: ~18-27 per team → ~1-3 per team (matches real football 1.3-1.5)\nExpected scoreline range: 0-0 through 5-0, with most matches 1-0 to 3-2\n\n========================================\nTUNING PRIORITY ORDER\n========================================\n\nIf implementing incrementally, apply in this order for maximum impact:\n1. AREA 1 (decision cadence) — biggest single lever, ~3-4x reduction alone\n2. AREA 5 (shooting difficulty) — thresholds + inaccuracy + team cooldown\n3. AREA 3 (defensive effectiveness) — interceptions + tackle range\n4. AREA 2 (control/transition times) — slows down action chains\n5. AREA 4 (pressing/marking) — closes defensive gaps\n6. AREA 6 (goalkeeper) — reduces conversion of shots that get through\n7. AREA 7 (dead ball time) — final polish for realism\n\nAfter each area, run 20+ test matches and compare stats against the calibration targets table. Adjust individual constants up or down based on results.\n\n========================================\nQUICK SMOKE TEST\n========================================\nTo quickly validate this approach before implementing all 7 areas, just change these 3 constants and run 10 test matches:\n1. Decision interval minimum: 0.50s → 2.0s (playerStateController.js:159)\n2. Shot threshold close: 0.72 → 0.85 (aiConstants.js:9)\n3. Shot threshold distant: 0.82 → 0.93 (aiConstants.js:10)\nThis alone should reduce goals from 20+ to ~5-8 per team, confirming the diagnosis."
